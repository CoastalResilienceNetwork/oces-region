            "description": "<p>Ocean resources in the Caribbean have the potential to make a much greater contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity for the regionâ€™s growing population of 40 million than they do currently, and to increase the resilience of people to climate change. The Caribbean region has been at the forefront of a movement towards the development of the blue economy and is home to a growing number of developing states that share the Caribbean Sea and have embraced the concept as the centerpiece of future growth strategies.</p> <p>This mapping tool is a dedicated extension of the Mapping Ocean Wealth Data Explorer developed specifically to support the Caribbean Regional Oceanscape Project (CROP). The objective of CROP isto improve systems and put relevant structures in place in an effort to foster a Blue Economy and to promote greater consideration of the ecosystem functions and services, which the ocean provides for member states.</p> <p>Under CROP, The Nature Conservancy(TNC)will be using the Mapping Ocean Wealth approach to develop ecosystem service models at the scale of the Eastern Caribbean. We will refine and adapt existing coral reef tourism and fisheries models, while developing novel methodologies to characterize recreational fishing and other types ofnature-dependent tourismin participating Eastern Caribbean countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines). These data will support these countries in ongoing and future marine spatial planning through the direct provision of spatially explicit information on their ecosystem service values, particularly relating to fisheries and nature-based tourism.This data explorer will be a tool to explore the mapped outputs of these models, along with country-specific reports and statisticsonce they are finalized in 2020.</p> <p>As the models are being developed, we will populate this tool with existing relevant regional reference data developed by TNC and its partners. The datasets populating the data portal do not represent an exhaustive inventory of Caribbean datasets, but rather, a selection of data layers that can be used to both contextualize and inform the ecosystem service models as they are being developed. </p> <p>Read more about this project <a href='https://oceanwealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CROP_MOW_Project_Overview.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p> <p>The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, in partnership with the World Bank is implementing CROP with support from the Global Environmental Fund (GEF). </p>",
